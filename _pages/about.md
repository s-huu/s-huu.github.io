I am currently a PhD student in Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously, I did my BA at Cornell University double major in Computer Science and Mathematics where I worked with [Kilian Q. Weinberger](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kilian/). My research focus on robust machine learning models and secure and privacy perserving machine learning algorithms. Topics I'm interested in particular are federated learning, privacy preserving machine learning, differential privacy, adversarial robustness, etc
