I am a senior undergraduate student from Cornell University double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm currently applying for a PhD position.

My research focus on robust machine learning models and secure and privacy perserving machine learning algorithms. Topics I'm interested in particular are adversarial defense, membership inference attack and its defense, and machine learning over encrypted data. I have also worked on projects in other areas like Gaussian Process, graph representatioin learning, Neural Network compression, dynamic network analysis, learning theory, etc. Currently I'm working with [Prof. Kilian Q. Weinberger](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kilian/) on a black box adversary project and [Prof. Vitaly Shmatikov](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shmat/) on project developing stronger membership inference attack.
