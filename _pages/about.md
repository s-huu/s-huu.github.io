I am a fifth-year PhD student in [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Virginia Smith](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~smithv/). Prior to that, I did my BA at Cornell University double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. 

My research interest broadly lies in LLM alignment, machine unlearning, differential privacy, and trustworthy federated learning methods. My works focus on studying analytical formulations and efficient methods that provide both theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance on real world applications to handle these issues in federated learning.
